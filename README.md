## Greene Strategy and Analytics
# AI, computer vision and machine learning. Technical, policy and strategy solutions.


### Government AI and AV strategy, policy and risk
AI and governance work with MIT Media Lab, Harvard Berkman Klein Center, Harvard Law School, Harvard Kennedy School and private government clients including developing best practices for AI and ethics in government, universities and industry and advising local and regional governments internationally on AI and AV strategy, risk and policy.

### Technical Projects:
#### Dragon Paint: GANs, art and extreme data augmentation
An ongoing project exploring the limits of data augmentation and art generation, using expressive augmentation and GANs for generating style consistent cartoons characters and group variation from extremely small original data sets.

- [DragonPaint: Rule based bootstrapping for small data with an application to cartoon coloring. In Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Predictive Applications and APIs, volume 82, pages 1-9, Boston, MA, 2017](https://www.papis.io/proceedings)

- "An Infinite Parade of Giraffes: Expressive Augmentation and Complexity Layers for Cartoon Drawing", PAPIs Europe 2018 

- "GANs and Gaussian Filters for Design Propagation and Variation Across Groups of Cartoon Characters from a Single Example" (under review)

#### EqualAIs: Facial recognition adversarial attacks
MIT Media Lab/Harvard Berkman Center AI and Governance Assembly project, [EqualAIs](http://equalais.media.mit.edu/). Our team developed a white box, substitution model facial recognition adversarial attack prototype, successful against the major APIs, filed a FOIA with partners ACLU and a private law firm, presented at numerous conferences and published a collection of open source code and resources on facial recognition and adversarial attacks.
